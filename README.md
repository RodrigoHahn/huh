# Huh
Random excuse generator.

It returnes "The Bastard Operator From Hell"-style excuses.

# Usage

Module API is simple, use `excuse.get()` to get one random excuse or
`excuse.getAll()` to get an array with all of them.

```

var excuse = require('excuses')

excuse.get() // Returns 1 random excuse

// ie. 'virus attack, luser responsible'

excuse.getAll() // Returns an array with all excuses

```

# List

Basic list if boroved [here](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ballard/bofh/).

To add new excuses update `excuses.txt` file and send pull request.

It would be cool to have excuses in more different languages.
